# Stardew Valley Survey
Greetings!
This survey is a spontaneous idea that would have never left my head if I never got it done.
Stardew Valley is my favorite game of all time and it would not be in my character as a developer is I didn't make something (or rather, numerous things) related to the game!
The purpose of this project is to provide a survey for users to fill out very, VERY briefly and have a long-term collection of data going on where we can see things such as:
- favorite character
- favorite bachelor
- favorite bachelorette
- least favorite character
- favorite season
- best heart event
There will also be a box where you can add your own comments and suggestions!
After taking in suggestions, I will add things to this website as it gets more traction and see where it takes me!
